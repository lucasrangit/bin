bin
===

Scripts and programs I commonly use.

## gdbsudo

To workaround IDE's such as VS Code that don't make it easy to debug using gdb as root.

## *-reset.sh

Scripts to reset peripherals that don't behave well. Such as Thunderbolt docks on resume or USB mice and keyboards that lose connection randomly.

## git-*

For custom git commands see my repo https://github.com/lucasrangit/git-bin .
